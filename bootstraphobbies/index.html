				<p>I've always loved making music. The first instrument I learned to play was piano, and I've stuck with it ever since!
				 I took lessons when I was little, but ever since then I am proudly self-taught. I am bad at reading sheet music now, but I love playing by ear.
			  Other instruments I would collect or play were drums, violin, flute, recorder, marimba/xylophone, and especially ocarinas!</p>

			<h2>IT Security</h2>
			<p>Yes, my aspired profession is also one of my hobbies! I have been learning, researching, and implementing IT and security solutions and techniques since my sophomore year of high school.
			 With the skills I gained from self learning, I qualified for the cyber defense team during my freshman year at Mercer, which led me to intern at IBM security in 2019, and that led me to interning at Palo Alto this upcoming summer!
		 I hope to become a great threat intelligence analyst at either one of those amazing companies!</p>

	Overall, I think that my hobbies are pretty neat and I hope that you think so too. I try to be as well-rounded as I can.
	These hobbies are some of my favorite ways of relieving stress, boosting confidence, and feeling happy.

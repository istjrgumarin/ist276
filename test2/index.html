<summary>Project Description</summary>
	<h4>Project Description</h4>
	<p>For this project, I am planning to create a cyberpunk-themed webpage that includes a very simple JavaScript login authentication form.
		To go with this form, I want to create a tutorial for visitors on how to potentially use simple website exploitation techniques to potentially crack or bypass the password authentication required by the login form.

	<p>As a neat add-on, I am also hoping to make the site double as a directory on current trends in cybersecurity, particularly relating to cyber threat intelligence.
		Unfortunately, I've read that JavaScript can't parse and pull data from external sites to display them (I believe I would have to use a programming/scripting language such as python for that, and I am unsure whether or not this can fit with the scope of my project).</p>
	<p>If for some reason I am unable to describe how to break the authentication form, I can also focus primarily on creating my library of threat intelligence feeds, and using JavaScript instead to animate icons for each directory selecrtion.</p>

<!-- Your rationale for building this project. -->

<summary>Rationale</summary>
	<h2>My rationale for building this project.</h2>
	<p>I am an aspiring cyber security professional who wants to specialize in cyber Threat Intelligence gathering.
		I think it would be cool to share my interest ii the topic in a cool and somewhat interactive way with my peers, professors, and other aspiring cyber professionals in a stylish way that I can identify with.
		The cybersecurity industry is suffering from a significant talent and skills shortage, and this website can be a potentially way to spark new interest in potential security candidates.</p>

<summary>Target audience</summary>
	<h2>My target audience for this proposed site.</h2>
	<p>My intended target audience for this proposed site is anyone who wants to learn something new about cybersecurity, and also for cyber security practitioners and personnel who want to get the latest scoop on threat intelligence.
		But I hope that this can especially appeal to lovers of the cyberpunk genre and general tech enthusiasts such as myself.</p>

<!-- While HTML and CSS are 'everywhere' in a wepage, describe how you might incorporate Javascript into this project. -->
<div>
<details>
<summary>Javascript Incorporation</summary>
	<h1 class="blinking">Authentication!</h1>
	<p>I plan to leverage HTML and CSS to create a sort of cyberpunk ambiance. I would prefer to select a color pallette that matches with those of cyberpunk artwork, such as that found on the BladeRunner or Neuromancer cover art. I can also decorate the site with more retrowave pictures or .gif files.</p>
	<p>The implementation of JavaScript is critical for this project in the creation of a simple login form, as well as to store variables that can be inputted for a successful login.
		I have found multiple ways of creating an authentication form online (all achieving basically the same thing), and one particular way includes using arrays and variables to test for for what inputs in the login form return a true boolean value.
	So in this way, no databases (such as SQL are required).</p>
	<p>Again, JavaScript can also be used to create animations for icons and directory selections when a user moves their mouse over an object on the site</p>

<summary>GitHub management</summary>
	<h4>How I will use GitHub to manage this project.</h4>
	<p>I plan to use GitHub to manage this project the same way I have for previous projects: I typically clone my repository on my local computer, and throw it on to a text editor such as Atom.
	I then update the repository by uploading the files I have created or edited. Because I'm working solo, I feel that managing this project by myself will be a breeze B)</p>

<!-- We will have only 4 weeks to complete this project. Clearly define weekly milestones for the successful completion of this project. -->
<div>
<details>
<summary>Milestones</summary>
<h4>Weekly milestones:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Week 1 - Finish HTML to create overall layout and content of webpage. Also reasearch on different examples of cyberpunk webpages and artwork ot be later implemented. Also make a list of what Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds I would like to include as links, and add them to the webpage in a list!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Week 2 - Implement CSS to style the whole webpage according to my theme! Also select and add my desired colors, pictures, and .gif files to the webpage to make it pop!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Week 3 - Have the JavaScript authentication form completed. Test it and try to break it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Week 4 - Complete tutorial on how to perform the Web Exploitation attack (if successful). If unsuccessful, focus on animating threat intelligence feed selections with JS. Also add finishing touches. These finishing touches can include (but are not limited to) final edits in formatting and HTML/CSS</p>
	</li>
